# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a hash in Ruby?

  Your answer:
  A hash is similar to JavaScript objects in that they are both a collection of key:value pairs. They can also be part of a class and inherit attributes from the class. At LEARN Academy, I have had to create hashes, objects, and classes for React apps, Ruby on Rails databases, and as part of programing exercises.

  Ruby differs from JavaScript in that Ruby practices a concept called Duck Typing. It means that classes that share similar characteristics can use the same methods. For example, hashes, arrays, and ranges are all enumerable which means methods like .map or .each work on them.


2. What is a gem?

  Your answer:
  A gem is a Ruby library or framework. It allows for added functionality or automates processes for the developer. A gem I was recently introduced to was Ruby on Rails. It's a gem that uses a ton of other specialized gems to quickly create web apps. Without gems a developer could spend hours to get the same functionality as what a gem can do in minutes.

  Another great gem I've been using is RSpec. It a testing framework that supports behavior driven development. It can be tedious writing a test that is three times as long as the code it's testing, but it's good to check that everything is working well together.


3. What is Ruby on Rails?

  Your answer:
  Ruby on Rails is a Ruby gem that allows for the relatively fast creation of a web application. We were introduced to it at LEARN Academy where we would create databases and migrate updates. I haven't created any web apps with it yet, but the cohort before me demonstrated various full stack apps they developed using Rails. I'm excited to learn more about Rails' potential.

I also learned that a wide variety of different sites use Rails such as Twitch, coinbase, airbnb, and GitHub.




4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer:
  A relational database is a database that is organized by row and columns like an Excel spreadsheet. The columns have the data attributes and the rows identify the data with primary keys. Outside of my experience with Excel, I've been introduced to relational databases with PostgreSQL and building simple ones with Ruby on Rails.

  Another type is the NoSQL database. It's structured similar to a home computer's file and folder system. It's commonly used in cloud computing and makes it easier to expand in the future.

5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer:
  Primary keys are unique identifiers assigned to each hash within a relational database. They are important because they are immutable. That ensures a developer knows exactly what entry they are using or manipulating. Even if an entry is deleted, the primary key is not reused.

  Researched answer:
  Primary keys are unique identifiers assigned to each table within a relational database. They are important because they are immutable. That ensures a developer knows exactly what entry they are using or manipulating. Even if an entry is deleted, the primary key is not reused. They are important because relational databases cannot work without them. There would be no way for the database to know the difference between duplicate tables.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes:
  Stands for REpresentational State Transfer and it is a standardized route for web developers to use that allows users to better understand a web app.

2. JSON:
  Stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It's the syntax for writing objects in JavaScript.

3. ERB:
  Stands for Embedded RuBy. It's for embedding Ruby into HTML.

4. Params:
  In Rails, it refers to parameters being passed to the controller via a get or post request.

5. API:
  Stands for Application Programming Interface. It allows two apps to communicate with each other.
